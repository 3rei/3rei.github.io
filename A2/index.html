                <h3>A keyboard is a peripheral device that features a series of keys which, when pressed,
                 send signals to a computer or other device to register input. These signals are then interpreted 
                 by the device's software to produce characters on a screen or execute specific commands.

                <h3>Keyboards are essential input devices used in various computing and typing tasks.
                     Over the years, they have evolved into a diverse range of options,
                     each catering to different user preferences and needs. Whether you're a casual typist,
                     a professional gamer, or seeking ergonomic solutions, there's a keyboard type that suits your requirements.

                <h3>Before keyboards, typewriters were the primary writing machines,
                    using paper and offering no easy way to undo mistakes.
                    In 1868, the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced,
                    marking a significant advancement in keyboard technology. 
                    The typewriter revolutionized written communication,
                    paving the way for modern keyboards with its QWERTY layout, still used today.

                <br><br><br>
                <h3>Now, future keyboards are using a new set of switches which utilises the hall effect, with the keyboard to do it being the Wooting keyboard!
                    The Hall Effect is a physics phenomenon where an electrical voltage is produced perpendicular to the direction of an electric current flowing
                    through a conductive material in the presence of a magnetic field. In keyboards, 
                    Hall Effect sensors can be used to detect the proximity of magnets attached to the key switches.
                    By adjusting the strength of the magnetic field, 
                    the actuation point of the switches can be changed dynamically, 
                    enabling faster and more precise key presses as users can customize actuation to their preference in real-time.
